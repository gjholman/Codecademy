Machine Learning Notes

- Founded by IBM's Arthur Samuel
	- Developed a game that played checkers in 1959
	- The field of study that gives computers the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed
- Concept originally thought of by Alan Turning -> can machines think?
	- From his published Computing Machinery and Intelligence

- Supervised vs. Unsupervised Learning
	- Supervised learns to predict the output from the input data
		- Regression
			- Continuous valued output: Housing Price in New York? Cryptocurrency Value?
		- Classification
			- Predict discrete number of values: Is this a picture of a dog? How many dogs? Is this email spam?
	- Unsupervised Learning learns the inherent structure of a dataset

- Linear Regression
	- Best fit line
	- Convergence: when loss stops changing
